# AndroidDoodleApp
This is a doodle app that I've created for my Android dev class

To install on your computer, import this project into android studio and press run to run inside an android emulator.

The main functions of this application are clear, change brush size, undo, and choose color, as well as draw.

Clear clears the drawing board

Change brush size will increase or decrease brush size depending on what button your press.

Undo, undoes the last stroke you made

The color picker at the bottom of the app allows you to choose which color you would like to paint with

And lastly, the whitespace in the center of the application is where you can draw or sketch.
